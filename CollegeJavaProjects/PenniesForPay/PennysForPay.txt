//Instructions
/*

1. Ask the user how many days they will be working until the end of the period.
2. Perform input Validation
3. Use a loop to keep a running total and calculate the amount earns for that day

notes:
a. the starting salary for day one is always .01
b. each day after day one, the amount will double(Day 2 - .02, Day 3 - 0.4, ect)
c. Number inputed must be greater than 0 for it to work.(This is where the Input Validation comes in.)

//Import Statement

//public class
	//public void main method
		///variables
		//input(days the user will be working)
			//double days_In_Period = -1; (for validation purposes)
		//salary for the day.(this variable will be the one doubling)
			//double salary = 0.01; (starts at the value of a penny)
		//runningTotal
			//totalSalary = 0; (to be able to do math)
			
		
		///nested loop
		//Reasons: You will be able to do the input validation inside and will save time.
		//while(days_In_Period < 1) //The initializing ensures this loop will run
		{
			//ask for input
			"How many days will you be working?"
